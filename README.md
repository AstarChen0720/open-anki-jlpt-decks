[![CI workflow](https://github.com/jamsinclair/open-anki-jlpt-decks/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jamsinclair/open-anki-jlpt-decks/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> Open source and updatable JLPT vocabulary Anki decks.

This project contains the notes for vocabulary used in JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) tests from N1 to N5. Flashcard decks, for the spaced repetition software [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), are generated from the notes.

The notes are stored in csv files to allow easy editing and reviewing of changes. Newer decks will be generated from any changes.

You can see the notes for each test level:
- [**N1 Vocabulary List**](src/n1.csv)
- [**N2 Vocabulary List**](src/n2.csv)
- [**N3 Vocabulary List**](src/n3.csv)
- [**N4 Vocabulary List**](src/n4.csv)
- [**N5 Vocabulary List**](src/n5.csv)

This project aims to solve many problems with existing anki decks that grow stale. This project gives **you** the **power** to help everyone.
